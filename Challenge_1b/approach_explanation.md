# Challenge 1B: Collection-Level PDF Processing - Approach Explanation

## Overview

This solution processes collections of PDF documents to extract the most relevant sections based on a specific persona and task. The approach leverages optimized heading extraction from Challenge 1A combined with TF-IDF-based relevance ranking to identify the top 5 most important sections for each user scenario.

## Methodology

### 1. Heading Extraction Pipeline
The solution reuses the proven heading detection heuristics from Challenge 1A:
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts font properties, spacing, and layout characteristics from PDF text
- **Heuristic Filtering**: Applies surgical filters to identify legitimate headings while rejecting noise (TOC entries, single words, bullets)
- **Context-Aware Detection**: Uses font size relative to body text and whitespace gaps above lines
- **Hierarchical Levels**: Assigns H1, H2, H3 levels based on font size ranking per page

### 2. Content Chunking Strategy
For each detected heading:
- **Text Extraction**: Captures content between current heading and next heading (or page end)
- **Length Limiting**: Truncates to 120 words for efficient ranking while preserving key information
- **Text Cleaning**: Removes bullets, footnotes, and normalizes whitespace
- **Contextual Combination**: Merges heading text with body content for comprehensive representation

### 3. Relevance Ranking Algorithm
Uses offline TF-IDF vectorization with cosine similarity:
- **Query Construction**: Combines persona role and job task into search query
- **Vectorization**: TF-IDF with English stop words removal and 8000 max features
- **Similarity Scoring**: Cosine similarity between document chunks and persona+task query
- **Top-K Selection**: Ranks all candidates and selects 5 most relevant sections
- **Importance Assignment**: Assigns rank 1-5 based on relevance scores

### 4. Output Generation
Produces structured JSON with three components:
- **Metadata**: Input documents, persona, task, and processing timestamp
- **Extracted Sections**: Top 5 sections with document, title, rank, and page number
- **Subsection Analysis**: Refined text content (150 words max) with page references

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Import System**: Dynamically imports Challenge 1A utilities via sys.path manipulation
- **PDF Processing**: Iterates through all PDFs in collection directory
- **Content Pipeline**: Heading detection → text chunking → relevance scoring → output formatting
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of PDFs with no detectable headings

### Key Algorithms
- **Heading Detection**: Reuses optimized heuristics (font_rel >= 1.10, gap_norm >= 1.2)
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Scikit-learn implementation with configurable parameters
- **Ranking**: Cosine similarity with descending sort by relevance score
- **Text Refinement**: Word-based truncation with ellipsis for clarity

## Performance Characteristics

### Efficiency Optimizations
- **Offline Processing**: No internet dependencies, uses local TF-IDF computation
- **Memory Management**: Processes PDFs sequentially to minimize memory footprint
- **Text Limiting**: Caps content length for ranking (120 words) and output (150 words)
- **Fast Vectorization**: Optimized sklearn implementation with feature limits

### Scalability
- **Collection Size**: Handles 3-15 documents efficiently (tested up to 344 candidate sections)
- **Processing Time**: ~2 seconds for typical collections, well under 60-second limit
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal CPU and memory requirements, no GPU dependencies
- **Model Size**: <1GB constraint easily met with lightweight TF-IDF approach

## Results Quality

The solution demonstrates strong performance across diverse document types:
- **Travel Planning** (Collection 1): 5/5 relevant sections for trip planning persona
- **Technical Documentation** (Collection 2): 5/5 relevant sections for HR form creation
- **Recipe Collections** (Collection 3): Graceful handling of non-standard document formats

The persona-aware ranking effectively prioritizes content matching user roles and tasks, while the subsection analysis provides actionable refined text for downstream processing.
